# Title
Frozen‑embedding fusion with FFNN head and network reasoning for candidate triage across multi‑omics contexts

## Abstract (150–250 words)
[Short summary of method, dataset slice, and principal findings.]

## Introduction
- Problem framing & gaps
- Contribution: frozen embeddings + FFNN + network ranking + calibration

## Methods
- Data (subset description, inclusion, preprocessing)
- Model (feature fusion, FFNN, training)
- Evaluation (splits, metrics: AUC/AP/Brier/ECE, reliability)
- Network ranking (net_strength, betweenness, sensitivity analysis)
- DoE planning (small prospective design)

## Results
- Discrimination & calibration
- Top‑K stability & sensitivity
- Case studies (2–3 candidates with evidence genes, enrichment summary)

## Discussion
- Strengths, limitations (distribution shift, label scarcity)
- Prospective validation plan & expected effect sizes

## Reproducibility
- Exact commands, seeds, artifact hashes (link to REPRODUCIBILITY.md)
